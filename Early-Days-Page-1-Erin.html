                                It’s a new day.





                                But nothing feels new.
                                
                                You start your day the same as any other. Looking through the various newspapers and folders you’ve recovered that might possibly have anything to do with the lab 
                                where the apocalypse started. You’ve dedicated your life to finding the cause of it and getting revenge on the person who took everything from you.
                                
                                But for now, you’re quite hungry.
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                Making your way to the main house of the Sanctuary you see down on the ground the not-so-unusual sight of Casey trying to explain to Ash why 
                                explosives are dangerous. Ash has always kind of worried you. Especially with the relatively unstable nature of your living situation. 
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                However, nothing has gone wrong yet… aside from almost half of his body getting blown off.
                                
                                You enter the main house to see Bailey and Milo sitting on the couch playing with Milo’s keyboard. They look like they’re having a lot of fun, but are also quite tired.
                                
                                “You two are up early, for you at least.” you say as you make your way to the kitchen.
                                
                                Bailey replies “Milo had an idea for a song in the middle of the night and didn’t want to forget it, so we’ve been up since then working on it!”
                                
                                Instead of carrying on the conversation any longer, you get lost in your own thoughts. Thoughts of wishing you had someone
                                 that you could irresponsibly throw away a whole night of much needed rest in exchange for having some fun for once in your life. Getting 
                                 lost in these thoughts leads to you just staring at them, kind of awkwardly, before walking away to the dining table to eat your buttered toast.
                                
                                After eating, you return to your room and spend the next few hours studying your notes.
                                
                                Getting basically nowhere, you begin to drift off into sleep, which is suddenly interrupted by a knock at your door.
                                
                                After you give permission to enter, Casey comes in and sits on your bed and begins to speak.
                                
                                “You’re still doing this?”
                                
                                Slightly annoyed, you respond “Yeah… why would I have stopped? I still don’t know who did this, therefore I still haven’t gotten revenge on them.”
                                
                                “A life driven by revenge isn’t really on a track to be a good one.”
                                
                                This stops and makes you think for a second, only for the anger and hatred to fill you up again, blinding you to the truth once more.
                                
                                “What makes a life good is subjective. Was there something you wanted when you came in here?”
                                
                                “I just wanted to see how you’re doing. I guess I’ll leave you to it.”
                                
                                Looking disappointed in you, Casey leaves your room and gently closes the door behind herself.
                                
                                You begin to think about your life decisions and how they not only affect you, but also everyone else. You thought earlier that you wanted someone to just
                                 have some fun with or talk to, and now someone just came into your room clearly caring about you. Maybe this is, or now was, the person that that could 
                                 have been. But it’s too late now. You’ve dedicated your life to killing someone you’ve never even met. Maybe it’s not too late… maybe you can still- wait!
                                
                                Your self reflection is suddenly interrupted by a breakthrough in your research. You begin to notice things that you haven’t before, connections that all 
                                make sense and seem to bring you much closer to the truth. It looks like it might all be worth it after all. You really hope it will be.
