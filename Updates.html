                                    With another <a href="https://youtu.be/C5RCV5Ux60k">new music video</a> for the series completed, I have learned a bit more about the process that I want to use for backgrounds
                                    for the pilot!
                                    <br><br>
                                    In the new music video, I 3D modeled Erin and Casey's rooms and used the models are a base for reference when drawing the final backgrounds.
                                    This allows me to draw the backgrounds much faster than before, as well as keep furniture placment and sizing very consistent!
                                    <br><br>
                                    With this new technique, making the pilot may take a bit longer, since I now have to 3D model all of the locations. However, future epsiodes may
                                    go way faster, since I'll already have a lot of the main locations made!

                                    With two practice animations now done to get a feel for animating the characters, I am now ready to move on to the beginning of work
                                    on the pilot episode!
                                    <br><br>
                                    While I was making those animations, I was also writing the script for the series. At the time of writing this, I have two entire episodes
                                    written, and a pretty good idea of the next few. I've already started work on the animatic, and it's coming along well!
                                    <br><br>
                                    I expect the episode to be somewhere between 15-20 minutes based on the script. That means it will still be quite a while before it's 
                                    even close to being released, but just beginning work on the series is already very exciting!

                                    With the Bubbly animation now done, it's time to move on to the next big project! This one is another animated music video, the song being 
                                    "What a Wicked Gang Are We" by Streetlight Manifesto. It once again mostly follows Erin, but there will be another character who makes a major 
                                    appearance in this one as well!
                                    I've recently started really getting into the writing part of making this series, so hopefully I'll have some real story to show relatively soon 
                                    (relative in terms of how long animation takes, so it still may not be this year unfortunately)
